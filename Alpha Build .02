I haven't found the time to mess around with gitHub still, but this is a small update to the game.

- When you fall in the pits you "die". This just means you can press 'R' to respawn and you spawn right before the room you died in.
- You can also shoot and destroy the turrets.
- Implemented a health system, although it's invisible currently and the only thing that hurts you are the pits

For the next build I will be stopping the player from moving and such when they die, also, I will be implementing the turrets tracking and
firing at the player. I would like to have the turrets spawn in as you enter the room, so as not to have all the turrets on the level detecting
and firing at the player at once, but I am not quite sure how to go about doing this. It's a plan for the future, but will more than
likely not be in the next build. It may end up there though, I'm just not sure yet. 

In the final build (probably the one after the next) I will just be polishing things, making textures for the turrets and pits (spikes nd lava)
as well as maybe having some sort of win text or scene of some sort. As well as adding moving platforms over the pits so that you can cross
them with the base jump (the current jump is very high on purpose, as to allow traversing the level).

I do plan on learning more about gitHub between now and the next build so I can actually upload the files, but it's kind of my least priority 
right now as I would really like to just be able to say I have completed what I've set out to do. If worse comes to worse only the final
build will have the files and scripts on here.
